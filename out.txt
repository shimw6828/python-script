Enfuvirtide	DB00109	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00109.sdf	159519-65-0	Enfuvirtide binds to the first heptad-repeat (HR1) in the gp41 subunit of the viral envelope glycoprotein and prevents the conformational changes required for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. It works by disrupting the HIV-1 molecular machinery at the final stage of fusion with the target cell, preventing uninfected cells from becoming infected. Enfuvirtide is a biomimetic peptide that was rationally designed to mimic components of the HIV-1 fusion machinery and displace them, preventing normal fusion. 	Envelope glycoprotein	Not Available
Vidarabine	DB00194	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00194.sdf	24356-66-9	Vidarabine stops replication of herpes viral DNA in 2 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, and consequently 2) incorporation into and termination of the growing viral DNA chain. This drug is a nucleoside analog and therefore has to be phosphorylated to be active. Vidarabine is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP. This is the active form of vidarabine and is both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase. When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading to the formation of ‘faulty’ DNA. This is where ara-ATP is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand	DNA polymerase catalytic subunit	inhibitor

Penciclovir	DB00299	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00299.sdf	39809-25-1	Penciclovir has <i>in vitro</i> activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). In cells infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2, viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form. The monophosphate form of the drug is then converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases. The intracellular triphosphate of penciclovir is retained <i>in vitro</i> inside HSV-infected cells for 10-20 hours, compared with 0.7-1 hour for acyclovir. <i>in vitro</i> studies show that penciclovir triphosphate selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Inhibition of DNA synthesis of virus-infected cells inhibits viral replication. In cells not infected with HSV, DNA synthesis is unaltered. Resistant mutants of HSV can occur from qualitative changes in viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase. The most commonly encountered acyclovir-resistant mutants that are deficient in viral thymidine kinase are also resistant to penciclovir.	DNA polymerase catalytic subunit	inhibitor

Tenofovir disoproxil	DB00300	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00300.sdf	201341-05-1	Tenofovir inhibits the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5&#39;-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Specifically, the drugs are analogues of the naturally occurring deoxynucleotides needed to synthesize the viral DNA and they compete with the natural deoxynucleotides for incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain. However, unlike the natural deoxynucleotides substrates, NRTIs and NTRTIs (nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitors) lack a 3&#39;-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. As a result, following incorporation of an NRTI or an NtRTI, the next incoming deoxynucleotide cannot form the next 5&#39;-3&#39; phosphodiester bond needed to extend the DNA chain. Thus, when an NRTI or NtRTI is incorporated, viral DNA synthesis is halted, a process known as chain termination. All NRTIs and NtRTIs are classified as competitive substrate inhibitors.	Reverse transcriptase/RNaseH	inhibitor
Cidofovir	DB00369	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00369.sdf	113852-37-2	Cidofovir acts through the selective inhibition of viral DNA polymerase.Biochemical data support selective inhibition of CMV DNA polymerase by cidofovir diphosphate, the active intracellular metabolite of cidofovir. Cidofovir diphosphate inhibits herpesvirus polymerases at concentrations that are 8- to 600-fold lower than those needed to inhibit human cellular DNA polymerase alpha, beta, and gamma(1,2,3). Incorporation of cidofovir into the growing viral DNA chain results in reductions in the rate of viral DNA synthesis.	DNA polymerase catalytic subunit	inhibitor
Famciclovir	DB00426	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00426.sdf	104227-87-4	Famciclovir undergoes rapid biotransformation to the active antiviral compound penciclovir, which has inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV). In cells infected with HSV-1, HSV-2 or VZV, viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that, in turn, is converted to penciclovir triphosphate by cellular kinases. In vitro studies demonstrate that penciclovir triphosphate inhibits HSV-2 DNA polymerase competitively with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Consequently, herpes viral DNA synthesis and, therefore, replication are selectively inhibited.	DNA polymerase catalytic subunit	inhibitor

Upon activation by kinases, the drug can be incorporated into the DNA which has the ultimate effect of inhibiting the HBV polymerase activity.	DNA	other
Rimantadine	DB00478	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00478.sdf	13392-28-4	The mechanism of action of rimantadine is not fully understood. Rimantadine appears to exert its inhibitory effect early in the viral replicative cycle, possibly inhibiting the uncoating of the virus.

Efavirenz	DB00625	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00625.sdf	154598-52-4	Similar to zidovudine, efavirenz inhibits the activity of viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase (i.e., reverse transcriptase). Antiviral activity of efavirenz is dependent on intracellular conversion to the active triphosphorylated form. The rate of efavirenz phosphorylation varies, depending on cell type. It is believed that inhibition of reverse transcriptase interferes with the generation of DNA copies of viral RNA, which, in turn, are necessary for synthesis of new virions. Intracellular enzymes subsequently eliminate the HIV particle that previously had been uncoated, and left unprotected, during entry into the host cell. Thus, reverse transcriptase inhibitors are virustatic and do not eliminate HIV from the body. Even though human DNA polymerase is less susceptible to the pharmacologic effects of triphosphorylated efavirenz, this action may nevertheless account for some of the drug&#39;s toxicity.

Emtricitabine	DB00879	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00879.sdf	143491-57-0	Emtricitabine works by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that copies HIV RNA into new viral DNA. Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of cytidine. It is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5&#39;-triphosphate, which is responsible for the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It competes with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5&#39;-triphosphate and incorporates into nascent viral DNA, resulting in early chain termination. Therefore emtricitabine inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5&#39;-triphosphate and by its incorporation into viral DNA. By inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, emtricitabine can help to lower the amount of HIV, or &quot;viral load&quot;, in a patient&#39;s body and can indirectly increase the number of immune system cells (called T cells or CD4+ T-cells). Both of these changes are associated with healthier immune systems and decreased likelihood of serious illness.	Reverse transcriptase/RNaseH	inhibitor

Tipranavir	DB00932	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB00932.sdf	174484-41-4	Tipranavir (TPV) is a non-peptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor that inhibits the processing of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1 infected cells, thus preventing formation of mature virions. Two mechanisms are suggested in regards to the potency of tipranavir: 1. Tipravanir may bind to the active site of the protease enzyme with fewer hydrogen bonds than peptidic protease inhibitors, which results in increased flexibility, allowing it to fit into the active site of the enzyme in viruses that have become resistance to other protease inhibitors. This also enables tipranavir to adjust to amino acid substitutions at the active site. 2. Tipranavir&#39;s strong hydrogen bonding interaction with the amide backbone of the protease active site Asp30 may lead to its activity against resistant viruses.

Due to it&#39;s lack of a 3&#39;-OH group, the formation of a 5&#39; to 3&#39; phosphodiester linkage that is necessary for DNA chain elongation is inhibited, thus leading to the termination of viral DNA growth.

Darunavir can also adapt to the changing shape of a protease enzyme because of its molecular flexibility.

Amprenavir interferes with this process by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.

Lopinavir	DB01601	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB01601.sdf	192725-17-0	Lopinavir inhibits the HIV viral protease enzyme. This prevents cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein and, therefore, improper viral assembly results. This subsequently results in non-infectious, immature viral particles.

Valganciclovir	DB01610	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB01610.sdf	175865-60-8	Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir that exists as a mixture of two diastereomers. After administration, these diastereomers are rapidly converted to ganciclovir by hepatic and intestinal esterases. In cytomegalovirus (CMV)-infected cells, ganciclovir is initially phosphorylated to the monophosphate form by viral protein kinase, then it is further phosphorylated via cellular kinases to produce the triphosphate form. This triphosphate form is slowly metabolized intracellularly. The phosphorylation is dependent upon the viral kinase and occurs preferentially in virus-infected cells. The virustatic activity of ganciclovir is due to the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by ganciclovir triphosphate. Ganciclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can longer to be built, destabilizing the strand. Ganciclovir inhibits viral DNA polymerases more effectively than it does cellular polymerase, and chain elongation resumes when ganciclovir is removed.	DNA	adduct

Inosine	DB04335	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB04335.sdf	58-63-9	Inosine has been found to have potent axon-promoting effects in vivo following unilateral transection of the corticospinal tract of rats. The mechanism of this action is unclear. Possibilities include serving as an agonist of a nerve growth factor-activated protein kinase (N-Kinase), conversion to cyclic nucleotides that enable advancing nerve endings to overcome the inhibitory effects of myelin, stimulation of differentiation in rat sympathetic neurons, augmentation of nerve growth factor-induced neuritogenesis and promotion of the survival of astrocytes, among others. The mechanism of inosine&#39;s possible cardioprotective effect is similarly unclear. Inosine has been reported to have a positive inotropic effect and also to have mild coronary vasodilation activity. Exogenous inosine may contribute to the high-energy phosphate pool of cardiac muscle cells and favorably affect bioenergetics generally. Inosine has also been reported to enhance the myocardial uptake of carbohydrates relative to free fatty acids as well as glycolysis. In cell culture studies, inosine has been found to inhibit the production, in immunostimulated macrophages and spleen cells, of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, interleukin (IL)-12, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma. It also suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production and mortality in a mouse endotoxemic model. These actions might account for the possible immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-ischemic actions of inosine.	Purine nucleoside phosphorylase	Not Available

Dasabuvir	DB09183	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB09183.sdf	1132935-63-7	Dasabuvir is a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the NS5B gene, which is essential for replication of the viral genome <sup>[<a href="#fda-reference">FDA Label</a>]</sup>. Based on drug resistance mapping studies of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, dasabuvir targets the palm domain of the NS5B polymerase, and is therefore referred to as a non-nucleoside NS5B-palm polymerase inhibitor. The EC50 values of dasabuvir against genotype 1a-H77 and 1b-Con1 strains in HCV replicon cell culture assays were 7.7 nM and 1.8 nM, respectively.	Nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B)	inhibitor
Ombitasvir	DB09296	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB09296.sdf	1258226-87-7	Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of the HCV non-structural protein 5A. While the precise role of this protein is unknown, it is essential to viral replication and virion assembly <sup>[<a href="#fda-reference">FDA Label</a>]</sup>. Potential modes of action of NS5A inhibitors like Elbasvir include blocking signaling interactions, redistribution of NS5A from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface of lipid droplets, and modification of the HCV replication complex <sup class="cite-this-group">[<a class="cite-this-popover-link" data-content="Bagaglio S, Uberti-Foppa C, Morsica G: Resistance Mechanisms in Hepatitis C Virus: implications for Direct-Acting Antiviral Use.

Paritaprevir	DB09297	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB09297.sdf	1216941-48-8	Paritaprevir is a potent inhibitor of the NS3/4A serine protease of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) <sup>[<a href="#fda-reference">FDA Label</a>]</sup>. Following viral replication of HCV genetic material and translation into a single polypeptide, Nonstructural Protein 3 (NS3) and its activating cofactor Nonstructural Protein 4A (NS4A) are responsible for cleaving it into the following structural and nonstructural proteins required for assembly into mature virus: NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. By inhibiting viral protease NS3/4A, paritaprevir therefore prevents viral replication and function.	NS3/4A protein	inhibitor
Tenofovir alafenamide	DB09299	https://www.drugbank.ca/structures/small_molecule_drugs/DB09299.sdf	379270-37-8	Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and a novel ester prodrug of the antiretroviral tenofovir. Following oral administration, TAF is converted in vivo to tenofovir, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate (nucleotide) analog of adenosine 5′-monophosphate. Tenofovir mimics normal DNA building blocks but is lacking a 3&#39;-OH molecule required for phosphodiester bond linkage. By competing with regular nucleotides for incorporation into proviral DNA and prevention of the formation of the 5&#39; to 3&#39; phosphodiester linkage required for DNA elongation, tenofovir causes early chain termination and prevents proviral DNA transcription.
